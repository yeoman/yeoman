## uninstall

Usage: yeoman uninstall <packageName>

Removes the package <packageName> from the current project.

Example:

```shell
yeoman uninstall backbone

# outputs:

bower uninstalling /project/browser_modules/backbone
```

Note: If you attempt to uninstall a package that is a dependency of other packages, yeoman (via Bower)
will throw an error. 

Example:

```shell
yeoman uninstall jquery

# outputs:
warning backbone depends on jquery
```

This simply means that you should uninstall backbone (the top-level package with the dependency) if you
wish to remove all traces of the jquery package.
