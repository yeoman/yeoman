[?] Which layout ? ([D]efault, [C]ustom, [S]illy) | layout
» [D]efault:  Standard html5-boilerplate layout

» [C]ustom:   Specific build of html5-boilerplate. A series of prompt allows
              explicit file rewrites for common files and directories.

» [S]illy:    A "silly" build will prompt for every file in the h5bp repository.

[?] CSS directory         (css/)            | css/
» You can change here the basic layout of the project you're about to
create. The defaults values will create a standars h5bp project, but you
might want to go for something different like:

    js/   → javascritps/
    css/  → stylesheets/
    img/  → images/

[?] Image directory       (img/)            | img/
[?] JavaScript directory  (js/)             | js/
