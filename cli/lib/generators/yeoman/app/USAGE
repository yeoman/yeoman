Description:
    The 'yeoman new' command creates a new yeoman application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

Example:
    yeoman new ~/Code/weblog

    This generates a skeletal yeoman installation in ~/Code/weblog.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
