author:   Original project: Tim Branyen, Generator: Addy Osmani
provides: HTML5 Boilerplate, jQuery, Backbone.js, Layout Manager, Mocha
usage:    yeoman init bbb

This boilerplate is the product of much research and frustration.  Existing
boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very
prescriptive; Backbone Boilerplate changes that.

Organize your application in a logical filesystem, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.

## Build process ##

To use the new and improved build process, please visit the
[grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb)
plugin repo and follow the instructions to install.  Basing your project off
this repo will allow the `bbb` commands to work out-of-the-box.
