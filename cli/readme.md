## Yeoman CLI

The Yeoman CLI presents a command line interface for creating, building, maintaining, and shipping a project.


## Quick start

```
# sudo npm install -g
# sudo npm link (otherwise you'll get exceptions at the moment during scaffolding setup)
```

Next, navigate to where you would like to create a new project and then run:

```yeoman init```

Todo: support ```yeoman init myapp```, currently ```yeoman init``` will work as will ```yeoman server```

**run the tests**

You can run the tests via `npm test` if you like. It will:

* create the `.test/` directory
* run `yeoman init --noprompt`
* copy in `.test/img` a few png files
* run `yeoman build:minify`
* and perfom few basic assertions, comparing *.html files in
`.test/publish` with the expected ones in `test/fixtures`

## Features

* Concats / Compresses JS
* Concats / Compresses CSS
* Inline CSS imports via
* Basic to aggressive html minification (via [html-minfier][])
* Optimizes JPGs and PNGs (with jpegtran & optipng)
* Renames JS/CSS to prepend a hash of their contents for easier versioning
* Revises the file names of your assets so that you can use heavy caching
* Updates your HTML to reference these new hyper-optimized CSS + JS files
* Experimental dom-based (with [JSDOM]()) build system.
* May rerun the build script on file changes (grunt's watch task &#10084;)
* May automatically reload the page in your browsers whenever watched files
  change, through some [socket.io] magic.

        server  Start a static web server.
          test  Run unit tests with nodeunit. *
         watch  Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.

The list of available tasks may change based on tasks directories or grunt
plugins specified in the "grunt.js" gruntfile or via command-line options.
