# Code of Conduct

"We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, ethnicity, religion, level of experience, or any other aspect of life. We expect anyone contributing to the Yeoman project to do the same."

All contributions to this project are valuable, including and not limited to posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests and providing feedback in comments. Please act with respect and avoid demeaning, condescending, racist, sexist and other inappropriate language and conduct. 

Please ensure comments stay professional, constructive and about the code, not the person.

This Code of Conduct applies to all of the projects under the [Yeoman organization](https://github.com/yeoman) on GitHub and the Yeoman community at large (IRC, mailing lists, Google+, Twitter, etc.).

See the [contributing guidelines](http://yeoman.io/contributing/) and the [tutorial on getting started with Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning/) for technical details of contributing to Yeoman or its satellite projects.

## Events

Any organizer running a Yeoman hackathon, meet-up, conference, user group, or other type of event is encouraged to adopt and provide an appropriate Code of Conduct. The [confcodeofconduct.com](http://confcodeofconduct.com) template is a good starting point. Participants should also have easy access to contact information that will allow them to privately get help or report violations of the Code of Conduct. 

For more on adopting a code of conduct, see [Ashe Dryden's FAQ](http://ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq_).

### How to Submit An Issue

On the far right of that screen is a big green button that says "New Issue". Click the button and it will take you to a screen like this:

Please make the Title of your issue "Code of Conduct Content Update"

Issues will be reviewed by the Yeoman core team. This is standard for the GitHub workflow, which works primarily to serve code reviews. Any delay in time between your request and its addition to the Code of Conduct is not an indication it has been received negatively.

Please note that some edits may be made to your suggestion, and this is also standard for the open source community and GitHub workflows. 

We welcome your thoughts and contributions.
