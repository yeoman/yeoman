    the `src/introduction.js` include the Jasmine introduction, with a
    lot of inline comments to help you get started with Jasmine. This is
    meant to be replaced by your own tests.

    The same introduction than the Jasmine doc page:
    http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/

    Choose a jasmine reporter.

    runner/ directory includes both environment for basic HTML reporting
    and a runner with the minimal amount of configuration required for
    running Jasmine specs in an headless environment.

    - headless.js:
    If you are on Unix or Windows, notice that there are a few issues
    running Jasmine specs via grunt-jasmine-task and PhantomJS if you
    change this default environment (see
    https://github.com/creynders/grunt-jasmine-task/issues/2 and
    https://github.com/creynders/grunt-jasmine-task/issues/4)

    - html.js:
    You may choose to use a slighly different environment with
    reporters like a jasmine.TrivialReporter or jasmine.HtmlReporter
    to see the results py pointing your browser to your spec runner.
