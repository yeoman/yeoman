# Custom Sublime Text 2 build file for Yeoman

Sublime populates its Tools/Build System menu based on the `.sublime-build` files stored in the Sublime `Packages` directory. To install `yeoman.sublime-build`, simply place this file within this directory.

Should one need to locate this path, it can be found in
* Ubuntu : `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/`
* OS X : `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User`

or the corresponding Packages/User directory on other platforms.
