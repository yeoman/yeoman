# Welcome, Friend!

## What am I?

Yeoman is a robust and opinionated client-side stack, comprised of tools and frameworks that can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications. We take care of providing everything needed to get started without any of the normal headaches associated with a manual setup.

Yeoman is fast, performant and is optimized to work best in modern browsers.

For more information about the project, see [yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io).


## Installing (pre-launch)

* Clone this repo and `cd` into it
* Run this command: `./setup/install.sh`
* `cd` into the `/cli` directory and run `sudo npm link`
* Navigate to a new directory and run `yeoman init` to make sure everything is working as expected.

You can keep Yeoman up to date by using `git pull --rebase upstream master && cd cli && npm link`.

**Make sure to pull in the latest and test before filing an issue, it might be fixed already**


## Documentation

Yeoman supports a powerful set of high-level commands. These include:

```shell
yeoman init      # Initialize and scaffold a new project using generator templates
yeoman build     # Build an optimized version of your app, ready to deploy
yeoman server    # Launch a preview server which will begin watching for changes
yeoman test      # Run a Mocha test harness in a headless Phantom.js

yeoman install   # Install a package from the client-side package registry
yeoman uninstall # Uninstall the package
yeoman update    # Update a package to the latest version
yeoman list      # List the packages currently installed
yeoman search    # Query the registry for matching package names
yeoman lookup    # Look up info on a particular package

```

A common initial workflow with Yeoman might be:

```shell
yeoman init      # Invoke the most basic application scaffold (Bootstrap, Boilerplate etc.)
yeoman build     # Build your project, creating an optimized version in the publish folder
yeoman server    # Create an intermediate version of your app, firing off a watch process

```

Some more examples of how to use our commands include:

```shell
yeoman init angular:bootstrap              # Invoke the AngularJS generator scaffold
yeoman init angular:controller             # Invoke the AngularJS Controller sub-generator
yeoman install jquery underscore [depName] # Install a dependency or dependencies
yeoman update jquery                       # Update a specific dependency (e.g jquery)
yeoman search jquery                       # Lookup jquery in the Bower registry
```


See the [complete documentation](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/tree/master/docs/cli) for more. We also have [extended documentation](https://github.com/mklabs/yeoman/wiki/_pages) available for those more interested in the Yeoman internals.



### Trouble-shooting

If for any reason you experience exceptions after the yeoman installation process above, you may find the
following steps resolve these issues:

```shell
cd yeoman/cli
sudo -s 'npm install -g && npm link'
```

Please also note that (pre-launch) commands such as `yeoman install`, `yeoman update` and `yeoman search` etc (i.e package management commands) will only work if you have [Bower](http://github.com/twitter/bower) installed. As this is also currently in private beta, please let us know if you need access and we'll sort that out.

Should you run into any further problems beyond this, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/new) and one of the team will be happy to follow up with you.



## Browser Support

* Modern browsers (latest version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera and IE10)
* Chrome on Android
* Mobile Safari


## Platform Support

Yeoman 1.0 will support OS X and Linux. We will be aiming to bring in support for Windows in a future version of the project.

## Contribute

We are more than happy to accept external contributions to the project in the form of feedback, bug reports and even better - pull requests :) At this time we are primarily focusing on improving the user-experience and stability of Yeoman for our first release. Please keep this in mind if submitting feature requests, which we're happy to consider for future versions.

### Repos

* [Yeoman (CLI, Insights)](http://github.com/yeoman/yeoman)
* [Yeoman I/O Holding Page](http://github.com/yeoman/yeoman.io)
* [Yeoman I/O Site](http://github.com/yeoman/yeoman.io) (site branch)

### Style Guide

This project follows the [jQuery Style Guide](http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines) with an exception of two space indentation and multiple var statements. Please ensure any pull requests follow this closely. If you notice existing code which doesn't follow these practices, feel free to shout and we will address this.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Lint the code by running `grunt` in the `/cli` folder before submitting a pull request
- Develop in a topic branch, not master

### Tests

Yeoman has a test suite to ensure it's reliably and accurately working as a developer tool. You can find the main test suite in [`test/test-build.js`](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/cli/test/test-build.js), most of the assertions are [checks against yeoman cli stdout](https://github.com/mklabs/yeoman/wiki/test-build).

To run our test suite:

```sh
npm test
```

Do note that if any CLI prompts are not accounted for the test suite will have a timeout failure.

### Developer Docs

We have significant developer docs for you if you'd like to hack on Yeoman.

Currently you can find much of the details on [mklabs' yeoman wiki](https://github.com/mklabs/yeoman/wiki/_pages) but also [our primary project](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/tree/master/docs/cli).

You're also welcome to `git blame` back to commit messages and pull requests. As a project we value comprehensive discussion for our fellow developers.

## About

Yeoman is an open-source project by [Google](http://google.com) which builds on top of [Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) and [node-build-script](http://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script). We utilize a number of useful open-source solutions including:

* Twitter Bootstrap
* HTML5 Boilerplate
* Modernizr
* Twitter Bower
* Node.js
* NPM
* Compass
* Socket.IO
* CoffeeScript
* Mocha
* Jasmine
* PhantomJS
* And [more...](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Dependencies)

Version 1 of the project features the combined efforts of:

* [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com)
* [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com)
* [Mickael Daniel](http://blog.mklog.fr)
* [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com)
* [Eric Bidelman](http://ericbidelman.com)

and other developers.

We will be aiming to officially release the project in Q3, 2012.

## Disclaimer

If you've been invited to try out the project as a beta tester or contributor, all we ask is that you refrain from publicly publishing/sharing the project sources until we have launched. This is to ensure that the first public version of Yeoman is as stable as possible, but would also stop unicorns from crying. Thanks for understanding :)
